Hi, ARandomRui here. 
So basically this project is to get me involved into the machine learning scene, for starters I decided to do a classification model for descriptions.

So here's my step-to-step though process
1. Try using a basic machine learning model (Linearregression, yes albeit the name, its a classification model), Maybe trying (SDKclassifier) next.
2. Fixing the dataset!! (I believe accuaracy can be fixed, I could be wrong, but hey I'm learning).
3. Summarize findings.

First Edition (Linear Regression, max_features=20000)
stats: 51% Accuaracy for test_data
